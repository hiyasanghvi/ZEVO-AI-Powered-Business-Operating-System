## Overview

Most small businesses rely on multiple disconnected tools for accounting, customer management, inventory tracking, invoicing, reminders, and reporting.

ZEVO solves this by providing a centralized business operating platform where all business data flows through a single system.

The platform supports multiple businesses, role-based access, financial analytics, inventory-aware billing, customer ledgers, operational workflows, and AI-assisted decision making.
